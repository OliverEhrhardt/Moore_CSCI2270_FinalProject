%4*Scott*Nick*Hey Nick, aren't you so glad we decieded to do CSCI 2270?
5*Nick*Scott*I am!  This class has taught me so much as well as allowed me to solve the worlds problems
6*Scott*Nick*Worlds problems?  You mean the fastest way to input entries into an array or designing a red black tree?  NO KIDDING!
7*Scott*all*Rememeber, if you "Switch Users" to a User that has not been made yet, that user will simply be created.  To delete that user, request (login) to the admin to delete that singular user
11*admin*all*admin can seen messages as blank when deleted.  Don't attempt to delete them again.  When saving to the file, those messages will not be written and at that time the problem is "fixed".
