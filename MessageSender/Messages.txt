%4*Scott*Nick*Hey Nick, aren't you so glad we decieded to do CSCI 2270?
5*Nick*Scott*I am!  This class has taught me so much as well as allowed me to solve the worlds problems
6*Scott*Nick*Worlds problems?  You mean the fastest way to input entries into an array or designing a red black tree?  NO KIDDING!
7*Scott*all*Rememeber, if you "Switch Users" to a User that has not been made yet, that user will simply be created.  To delete that user, request (login) to the admin to delete that singular user
11*admin*all*admin can seen all the messages!  So don't go messaging anything you wouldn't want your mother to see.
12*Nick*Scott*Exactly! Or even better - traversing graphs and building networks to avoid zombies.
