# Moore_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Project Summary:
This project will create a social messaging system where the user will log into a profile and from there either post messages to a public message board, send messages to specific profiles, delete their most recent post to the public message board, or delete a private incoming message.  When first running the program, the user will type in their user name.  This will create an account that they will use until they close the program or select to sign into another profile.  The messages created by the user will be stored within structs that contain information such as the creator and recipient of the message.  When the user selects to view all of the messages accessable to them, the messages will appear in reverse incoming order of private messages and then reverse incoming order for public messages.  This means that the most recent message sent to them privately will be displayed first and then after all private messages have been displayed the public messages will be displayed in the same fashion.
